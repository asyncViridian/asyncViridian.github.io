## Hello world!

This is my first experience using Jekyll on Github Pages. It looks like the template website is starting to shape up and I'm beginning to better understand how everything fits together. I'm still a CSS newbie so unsure how to fix the image alignment/spacing issues on the main page currently - ideally, I'd have what I do currently except all the text will line up nicely on the left side.

Here's some experimentation with formatting in Markdown for future reference.
- Do you remember how we came to that place?
- And they sang of their lightnings and shapeful disgrace?
- And we tilted our vanes and ennobled our spires.
- They welcomed us then and commingled all choirs.
