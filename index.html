      I'm currently working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld">Prof. Dan Weld</a> and <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bansalg/">Gagan Bansal</a> in the <a href="https://hai.cs.washington.edu/">Lab for Human-AI Interaction (HAI)</a>.
      My research interests very broadly lay in HCI, data visualization, AI, and computational biology.
