    <p>
      I am a 5th year BS/MS student studying computer science at the University of Washington Seattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently a Master's student under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/weld">Prof. Dan Weld</a> in the <a href="https://hai.cs.washington.edu/">Lab for Human-AI Interaction (HAI)</a>.
      My research interests very broadly lay in HCI (in particular human-AI interaction), data visualization, AI, ethics, and NLP. I'm also casually interested in research in fields such as those covered by SIGBOVIK :)
